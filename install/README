#**Installation**

## Requirements

### Programming Language

* **Python 3.11** is required for compatibility with all included scripts.

### Python Packages

Install the required Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pysam natsort numpy
```

### External Software Tools

The following tools are required and should be installed separately. These tools are used via absolute paths defined in the scripts.

```bash
conda install -c bioconda bwa samtools sambamba
```

You must modify the absolute paths in the scripts (`preprocess.py`, `preprocess1.py`) to reflect the location of these tools on your system:

```python
BWA_PATH = "/path/to/bwa"
SAMTOOLS_PATH = "/path/to/samtools"
SAMBAMBA_PATH = "/path/to/sambamba"
```
