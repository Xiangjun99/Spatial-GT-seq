It includes: 1) codes for processing and analyzing spatial-DNA-seq data, 2) codes for processing and analyzing spatial-RNA-seq data, and 3) codes for processing and analyzing single-cell DNA-seq data. Specifically, this repository is organized as following folders:

| Folder        | Purpose                                                                                                                                     | Visibility |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `install`             | Installing the required command line tools and packages of R and Python languages.                                                          | public     |
| `Spatial-DNA-seq`     | This tutorial uses a real sample in the manuscript to demonstrate how to preprocess and analyze wellDA-seq data.                            | public     |
| `Spatial-RNA-seq`     | Scripts to take the BCL files of wellDA-seq to create the single-cell CNA and ATAC matrices files.                                        | public     |
| `Single-cell DNA-seq` | Codes of computational analysis used in the manuscript. This folder is organized in the order of applications.                             | private    |
| `testData`            | Codes of data visualization shown in the manuscript. This folder is organized in the order of figures.                                     | private    |
